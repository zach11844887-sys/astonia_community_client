# Astonia Community Client

This is the community client for Astonia 3. It is based on, and compatible
with, the [client maintained by Daniel Brockhaus](https://github.com/DanielBrockhaus/astonia_client).

The main goal is to allow community driven development.

Further goals:

- Maintain backwards compatibility with the original game server.
- Maintain compatibility with all servers currently using the client.
- Keep it simple. No additional libraries, frameworks or tools unless absolutely needed.
- Whenever possible, put bugfixes in single commits for easy cherry-picking.
- Always have a downloadable Windows release with sensible hardware requirements and no software requirements.
- Work towards supporting more / all of the servers.

# Header filter to analyze project headers
HeaderFilterRegex: '.*'

# Disabled checks explanation:
# - easily-swappable-parameters: Too noisy for existing code
# - implicit-widening: Common pattern in game code
# - narrowing-conversions: Would require significant refactoring
# - signed-char-misuse: Platform-specific, not critical
# - insecureAPI warnings: Game client, not security-critical infrastructure
# - no-int-to-ptr: Used for specific low-level operations
